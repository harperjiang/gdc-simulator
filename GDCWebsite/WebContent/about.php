								<div>As a former employee at GE research center, Dr. Achuthan
									was a key member of the team who developed GE&prime;s fiber
									optic sensor system for the measuring real time temperature and
									strain inside the Radiant Syngas cooler (RSC) for Integrated
									Gassification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plant at Tampa
									Electrical Company&prime;s (TECO) power plant in Tampa,
									Florida. This $3.7M project was funded by Department of Energy
									(DoE). Dr. Achuthan was in charge of finding solutions to
									mitigate the challenges posed due to extreme conditions (high
									temperature, small strain, slag penetration, slag impact etc).
									The developed system successfully gathered data continuously
									for 60 days, more than the design period. Dr. Achuthan has also
									worked in the area of fiber optic sensor development for
									fouling detection. Dr. Achuthan received his Ph.D. from Purdue
									University (2004), his M.E. from the National University of
									Singapore, Singapore (2000), and an M.S. from the Indian
									Institute of Technology, Madras, India (1998). Dr.
									Achuthan&prime;s research, as a faculty member in Mechanical
									and Aeronautical Engineering Department at Clarkson University,
									is in the areas of solid mechanics and advanced materials. He
									is interested in studying and solving problems associated with
									the development of next generation of fiber optics sensors, and
									&Prime;small&Prime; scale devices such as MEMS and nanodevices.
									In the advanced materials area Dr. Achuthan&prime;s current
									focus include multiscale modeling of ferroelectric material
									behavior, Molecular Dynamic simulation of nanomaterial
									behavior, and developing composite materials for harsh
									environment conditions. Dr. Achuthan is also working on
									structural impact problems and thermal stress analysis problems
									for refractory structures. Dr Achuthan has published articles
									in peer-reviewed journals and received several patents.
