		<div class="text">Based on the project results, the Contractor shall
			address scalability, reliability, and optimization of the POD system
			through the development of design guidelines for a larger
			demonstration. The subsequent demonstration would include a larger
			turbine (50-100kW, potentially up to 1.5 MW) in order to show the
			feasibility of powering a much larger compute load, that typical of a
			full HP POD (20 feet containers) and would demonstrate the ability to
			deploy best-in-class technology relatively quickly compared to
			traditional brick-and-mortar data center facilities. The guidelines
			will also identify alternative configurations which are possible
			including the use of other power sources such as fuel cells.</div>
